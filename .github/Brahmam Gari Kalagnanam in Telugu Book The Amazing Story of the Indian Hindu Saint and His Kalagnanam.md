The word Kalagnanam means "knowledge of time" and it contains the predictions of Brahmam Garu about the past, present and future of the world. He wrote his prophecies on palm leaves and hid them in various places. Some of them were discovered by his followers and compiled into a book. The book covers various topics such as natural disasters, wars, social changes, religious conflicts, moral decay, divine interventions, etc.
 
Brahmam Garu also wrote some poems and songs in praise of Goddess Kali and Lord Shiva. He had many disciples who spread his teachings and prophecies. He attained Jiva Samadhi (a state of conscious exit from the body) at Brahmam Gari Matam in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh. His birthplace and ashram are pilgrimage centers for his devotees.
 
Brahmam Gari Kalagnanam is a fascinating and mysterious book that has intrigued many scholars and believers. It is believed that some of his prophecies are yet to be fulfilled and that he will return as Kalki, the final avatar of Vishnu, at the end of Kali Yuga.
