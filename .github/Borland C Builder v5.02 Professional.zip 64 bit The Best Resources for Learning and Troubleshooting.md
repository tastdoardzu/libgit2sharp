# Borland C Builder v5.02 Professional.zip 64 bit: A Review
 
Borland C Builder is a rapid application development (RAD) environment for writing programs in the C++ programming language. It combines the Visual Component Library and IDE written in Object Pascal with multiple C++ compilers. It also supports cross-platform development using the Firemonkey (FMX) library[^4^].
 
Borland C Builder v5.02 Professional.zip 64 bit is a file that contains the Borland C++ Compiler 5.02, which is a blazingly fast 32-bit optimizing compiler. It contains the latest ANSI/ISO C++ language support including, the STL (Standard Template Library) framework and C++ template support and the complete Borland C/C++ Runtime Library (RTL)[^2^]. It also targets Windows 3.1, 95, NT and DOS[^3^].

To install Borland C Builder v5.02 Professional.zip 64 bit, you need to download the file from a reliable source and extract it to your desired location. Then, you need to install an IDE that can detect the Borland C++ compiler, such as C Free[^2^]. After that, you can write and run your C and C++ programs using the IDE and the compiler.
 
Borland C Builder v5.02 Professional.zip 64 bit is a good option for developers who want to use a fast and powerful compiler for their C and C++ projects. It also allows them to use the same IDE as Delphi and share many core libraries with it. However, it may not be compatible with newer versions of Windows or other platforms, so you may need to upgrade to a newer version of Borland C Builder or use another compiler if you want to target those platforms.

In this article, we will show you how to write a simple program using Borland C Builder v5.02 Professional.zip 64 bit. The program will display a message box with the text "Hello, world!" when the user clicks a button.
 
First, you need to create a new project in your IDE. Choose File > New > Project and select C++Builder Application. Give your project a name and a location and click OK.
 
Next, you need to design the user interface of your program. You will see a blank form on the screen. To add a button to the form, go to the Component Palette and select the Standard tab. Then, drag and drop a TButton component onto the form. You can resize and move the button as you like. To change the caption of the button, go to the Object Inspector and find the Caption property. Change it to "Click me".

Now, you need to write the code that will execute when the user clicks the button. To do that, double-click on the button on the form. This will open the Code Editor with a template for the OnClick event handler of the button. Inside the curly braces, type the following code:
 `
ShowMessage("Hello, world!");
` 
This line of code will display a message box with the text "Hello, world!" when the button is clicked.
 
Finally, you need to compile and run your program. To do that, go to Project > Build All and wait for the compiler to finish. Then, go to Run > Run and see your program in action. You should see a form with a button that says "Click me". When you click it, you should see a message box that says "Hello, world!". Congratulations! You have just created your first program using Borland C Builder v5.02 Professional.zip 64 bit.
