## Go Kart Go! Turbo! Tips and Tricks to Boost Your Performance
 
Now that you know how to download and play Go Kart Go! Turbo! on your PC, you might be wondering how to improve your skills and beat your opponents. Go Kart Go! Turbo! is a game that requires quick reflexes, smart strategies, and smooth driving. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you master the game and have more fun:

- Open up the corners on entry â Whenever you approach a corner, try to open it up as much as possible by getting close to the white line so that you can carry more speed and ultimately be faster. That not only will improve your speed, but it will help you to get back on the gas sooner, which is crucial in go-kart racing.
- Brake later than anybody (without missing the apex) â Whenever you approach a braking zone, especially for really tight corners such as hairpins, you want to make sure that you hit those brakes hard and late so that youâll be able to catch all of your competitors. Not only will that be faster, but oftentimes it will help your kart to settle for a better exit speed. That is crucial for ultimate racing speed.
- Use all the road available on the exit â Do you think that you can stand any chance of being fast if you end up in the middle of the road on the exit? Wellâ¦ NO. Sorry for the bad news. If you want to be fast you have to pick up the throttle as soon as possible and run wide on the exit till the VERY limit, be it the white line, the exit curb or the air fence. By doing so your exit speed will be way higher than it used to be and you will pull away from your competitors behind.
- Aim for good exits out of the corners â Going back to what weâve just mentioned, having an optimal exit speed is crucial for being fast. That doesnât only involve running wide and using all the space on exit, but also picking the throttle sharp and early thus increasing the minimum and exit speed substantially. This is something drivers often overlook , as they tend to be focused more on the line, but it can make a big difference when youâre trying to get out of tight corners.
- Get fit for racing â Driving a go kart fast requires the driver to have stamina and endurance. To obtain this, it is crucial that the driver maintain their health through eating well and getting ample exercise. In addition, regular cardio exercise can increase a runner's speed on long distances by as much as fifty percent just through practice. That means that you should start hitting the gym at least 2-3 times per week and take runs and bike rides often to improve your physical shape. This tends to be the most overlooked aspect of go kart racing, but it can make a big difference when youâre competing against veteran drivers at the highest levels in the world.
- Don't lean â Avoid leaning towards the apex when you're turning. This puts more weight over your inside wheels, which can make it harder to straighten up after a turn.
- One pedal at a time â Stick to using one pedal at a time when you're racing. Don't try to brake and accelerate at the same time, as this will cause your kart to lose traction and speed. Instead, brake hard before the corner, release the brake smoothly as you turn, and then accelerate hard as you exit.

With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to improve your lap times and win more races in Go Kart Go! Turbo! Remember to practice regularly and have fun with this amazing kart racing game.
