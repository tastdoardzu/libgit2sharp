If you are new to Death Rally or want to improve your skills, here are some tips and tricks that can help you win more races and earn more money:
`  `
`
`- Choose your car wisely. Different cars have different strengths and weaknesses, such as speed, armor, handling, and weapon slots. You can also upgrade your car with better engines, tires, armor, and weapons. Experiment with different combinations and find the one that suits your playstyle.
`
`- Use your weapons strategically. You can equip your car with various weapons, such as machine guns, mines, rockets, and spikes. Each weapon has a different range, damage, and ammo capacity. You can also use power-ups that you find on the track, such as nitro boosters, repair kits, and extra ammo. Use your weapons to slow down or destroy your opponents, but be careful not to waste your ammo or damage yourself.
`
`- Learn the tracks. Each track has its own layout, obstacles, shortcuts, and hazards. Some tracks have more turns, jumps, or bumps than others. Some tracks have oil slicks, barrels, or crates that can hinder your progress or help you create chaos. Learn the layout of each track and use it to your advantage.
`
`- Watch out for the cops. Sometimes, the police will show up and try to stop the illegal races. They will chase you and shoot at you with their sirens and guns. They can also set up roadblocks or spike strips to stop you. Avoid them as much as possible or take them out if you have to.
`
`- Challenge the bosses. As you progress through the career mode, you will face different bosses who are the best racers in the game. They have unique cars and weapons that are more powerful than yours. They will also taunt you and try to intimidate you. To beat them, you will need to use all your skills and resources. If you manage to defeat them, you will earn their respect and their car.
