The movie opens with Ashok Kumar, along with his partner Maya (Nayantara), kidnapping Arjun (Arya), a talented hacker, and forcing him to join their mission. They hack and bring down the server of a media company, which is involved in some illegal activities. Arjun tries to escape from Ashok's clutches and informs the police about his whereabouts. The police team, led by Prakash (Kishore), arrests Ashok and Maya, but they manage to escape with the help of Sanjay (Rana Daggubati), who is revealed to be Ashok's former colleague at the Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS).
 
A flashback reveals that Ashok was an honest and brave officer at the ATS, who was betrayed by his senior Rane (Mahesh Manjrekar), who was working for a corrupt politician Ram Prasad (Atul Kulkarni). Rane killed Ashok's best friend and fellow officer Jai (Aman Dhaliwal) and framed Ashok for his murder. Ashok was arrested and tortured by Rane, but he escaped with the help of Sanjay and Maya, who was Jai's girlfriend. Ashok vowed to take revenge on Rane and Ram Prasad for their crimes.
 
The rest of the movie shows how Ashok executes his plan to expose and eliminate Rane and Ram Prasad, with the help of Arjun, Maya and Sanjay. He also faces challenges from Anitha (Taapsee Pannu), who is Arjun's girlfriend and an aspiring TV journalist, who wants to uncover the truth behind Ashok's actions. The movie ends with Ashok clearing his name and getting justice for Jai.
