## History of Carmina Burana
 
Carmina Burana is the name given to a collection of medieval Latin and German poems that were discovered in 1803 in a Benedictine monastery in Bavaria. The poems date from the 11th to the 13th centuries and cover various topics such as love, lust, gambling, drinking, satire, and criticism of the church and society. The name Carmina Burana means "Songs of Beuern" in Latin, referring to the town of Benediktbeuern where the manuscript was found.
 
The poems were written by different authors, mostly students and clergy, who belonged to a movement known as the Goliards. The Goliards were wandering scholars and poets who rebelled against the authority and hypocrisy of the church and the feudal system. They used humor, irony, and sarcasm to express their views and feelings. They also adopted a hedonistic lifestyle, celebrating life and pleasure in contrast to the asceticism and moralism of the church.
 
The poems of Carmina Burana are divided into four thematic sections: The Wheel of Fortune, The Roman de la Rose, The Court of Love, and The Songs for Drinking and Gaming. The Wheel of Fortune section contains the most famous poem of the collection, O Fortuna, which depicts the unpredictability and cruelty of fate. The Roman de la Rose section is based on a French allegorical poem that portrays the art of love. The Court of Love section consists of love songs and dialogues between lovers. The Songs for Drinking and Gaming section includes songs that celebrate drinking, gambling, and merry-making.
 
## Carl Orff's Musical Adaptation of Carmina Burana
 
In 1934, German composer Carl Orff came across a selection of Carmina Burana poems that had been translated into German by Johann Andreas Schmeller. Orff was fascinated by the poems and decided to set them to music. He composed a scenic cantata for soloists, chorus, orchestra, and dancers that premiered in Frankfurt in 1937. The cantata was an instant success and became Orff's most famous and performed work.
 
Orff's musical adaptation of Carmina Burana consists of 25 movements that follow the structure of the original manuscript. The cantata begins and ends with O Fortuna, creating a circular form that symbolizes the cycle of fortune. The music is influenced by medieval modes and rhythms, as well as by modern techniques such as ostinato and polytonality. The music is also characterized by its simplicity, repetition, and rhythmic drive.
 
Orff's Carmina Burana is a powerful and expressive work that captures the spirit and emotion of the medieval poems. It is a celebration of life, love, and fate that appeals to audiences of all ages and backgrounds.
