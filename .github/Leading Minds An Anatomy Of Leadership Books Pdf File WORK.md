These are some of the questions that Howard Gardner, a renowned psychologist and professor at Harvard University, explores in his book *Leading Minds: An Anatomy Of Leadership*. In this book, Gardner applies his theory of multiple intelligences to the study of leadership, and analyzes the lives and achievements of 11 influential leaders from different domains and historical periods.
 
Gardner argues that leadership is not a fixed trait or a set of skills that can be taught or learned. Rather, leadership is a complex process that involves three elements: the leader, the followers, and the situation. The leader must have a compelling story or narrative that articulates his or her vision and values, and that resonates with the followers and the situation. The followers must be willing and able to understand and accept the leader's story, and to act on it. The situation must provide opportunities and challenges for the leader and the followers to enact their story.
 
Gardner examines how 11 leaders - Margaret Mead, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King Jr., Pope John XXIII, Margaret Thatcher, Jean Monnet, Mahatma Gandhi, Alfred P. Sloan Jr., Igor Stravinsky, and Deng Xiaoping - developed and communicated their stories, and how they adapted to changing circumstances and crises. He also discusses how these leaders influenced their fields and societies, and how they dealt with their strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures.

However, not everyone agrees with Gardner's approach to leadership. Some critics have pointed out the limitations and biases of his method and his conclusions. For example, Michael A. Genovese, a professor of political science and leadership studies, argues that Gardner's book suffers from three major flaws: a lack of a clear definition of leadership, a lack of empirical evidence and testing for his claims, and a lack of attention to the ethical and moral dimensions of leadership[^1^]. Genovese also questions Gardner's choice of leaders and his reliance on biographical sources, which may not capture the complexity and diversity of leadership phenomena.
 
Another critic, Robert J. Sternberg, a professor of psychology and education, challenges Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences and its application to leadership. Sternberg contends that Gardner's theory is not a scientific theory, but a set of beliefs that are not falsifiable or measurable. He also argues that Gardner's theory does not account for the role of context, motivation, personality, and emotions in leadership[^2^]. Sternberg proposes an alternative theory of successful intelligence, which he defines as the ability to achieve one's goals in life by adapting to, shaping, and selecting one's environments.
 
Despite these criticisms, Gardner's book remains a valuable contribution to the field of leadership studies. It offers a novel and provocative way of looking at leadership from a cognitive perspective, and it stimulates further research and debate on the nature and development of leadership. It also provides rich and vivid examples of how leaders use stories to inspire and mobilize their followers, and how they cope with the challenges and dilemmas of leadership.
