On a mission to put this tool into the hands of the broader business world for the first time, Jeff Sutherland succeeds brilliantly." - Eric Ries, New York Times bestselling author of The Lean Startup[^2^]

Amazingly, this book will not only make your life at work and home easier, but also, better and happier." - Shawn Achor, New York Times bestselling author of Before Happiness and The Happiness Advantage[^2^]
- "Scrum is mandatory reading for any leader, whether they're leading troops on the battlefield or in the marketplace. The challenges of today's world don't permit the luxury of slow, inefficient work. Success requires tremendous speed, enormous productivity, and an unwavering commitment to achieving results. In other words, success requires Scrum." - U.S. General Barry McCaffrey[^2^]
