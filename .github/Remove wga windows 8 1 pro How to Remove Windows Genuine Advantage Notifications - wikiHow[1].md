Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) is a system that verifies the authenticity of your Windows copy and notifies you if it is not genuine. If you are using an unregistered or pirated version of Windows 8.1 Pro, you may see a watermark on your desktop, a pop-up message, or a balloon notification reminding you to activate your Windows. This can be annoying and distracting, especially if you are using your computer for work or entertainment. Fortunately, there are some ways to remove WGA notifications on Windows 8.1 Pro without having to buy a license or activate your Windows.

In this article, we will show you two methods to remove WGA notifications on Windows 8.1 Pro: one by activating Windows with a valid product key, and another by disabling WGA in the registry. Before we proceed, we advise you to backup your important files and create a system restore point in case something goes wrong. We also do not condone piracy or illegal use of software, and we recommend that you purchase a genuine copy of Windows 8.1 Pro from Microsoft or an authorized reseller.
 
## Method 1: Activating Windows with a Product Key
 
This is the easiest and most legal way of removing WGA notifications on Windows 8.1 Pro. If you have a valid product key for Windows 8.1 Pro, you can use it to activate your Windows and get rid of the WGA notifications. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Make sure that you are connected to the Internet.
2. Open the Start menu and click on Settings.
3. Click on Update & Security.
4. Click on the Activation tab on the left side of the window.
5. Click on Change product key.
6. Type in your product key and click Next.
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the activation process.

If your product key is valid and accepted by Microsoft, you should see a message that your Windows is activated and the WGA notifications should disappear.
 
## Method 2: Disabling WGA in the Registry
 
This is a more risky and complicated way of removing WGA notifications on Windows 8.1 Pro. It involves editing the registry, which is a database that stores important settings and information for your system. If you make a mistake or delete something important, you may cause serious problems for your computer. Therefore, we advise you to be very careful and follow the steps exactly as shown below:

1. Make sure that you are logged in as an administrator.
2. Open the Start menu and type in regedit. Click on regedit.exe to open the Registry Editor.
3. Click on Yes when prompted by User Account Control.
4. Navigate to the following key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform\Activation
5. Right-click on Manual and select Modify.
6. Change the Value data from 0 to 1 and click OK.
7. Close the Registry Editor and restart your computer.

This should disable WGA from checking your Windows activation status and stop showing you notifications.
 
### Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to remove WGA notifications on Windows 8.1 Pro using two methods: one by activating Windows with a product key, and another by disabling WGA in the registry.
