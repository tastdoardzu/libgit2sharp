Shimu learns that the factory owner has no intention of compensating the victims or improving the working conditions.
 
Shimu decides to join a union led by Nasima, a former garment worker and activist. She convinces some of her co-workers to sign up as well, despite the threats and harassment from the management and the police. Shimu faces many obstacles and challenges along the way, such as corruption, bureaucracy, patriarchy, and violence. She also discovers her own strength and voice, as well as the power of collective action.
