# How to Generate FSC Codes for Your BMW CIC Navigation System
 
If you want to update the maps on your BMW CIC navigation system, you will need a valid FSC code to do so. FSC stands for Freischaltcode, which is German for activation code. The FSC code is a 20-digit alphanumeric code that is required to unlock the map data on your navigation system.
 
There are two ways to get an FSC code for your BMW: you can either buy one from a dealer or a third-party seller, or you can generate one yourself using a software tool. In this article, we will show you how to easily generate FSC codes for your BMW CIC units by yourself using a free tool called BMW CIC FSC Generator.

## What You Need to Generate FSC Codes
 
To generate FSC codes for your BMW CIC navigation system, you will need the following items:
 
- A Windows computer with an internet connection
- A USB flash drive formatted in FAT32
- A 1B file extracted from your car's navigation unit
- The BMW CIC FSC Generator software
- The map data files for your desired region and version

### How to Extract the 1B File from Your Car
 
The 1B file is a file that contains information about your car's VIN, navigation system type, and map version. You will need this file to generate an FSC code that matches your car. To extract the 1B file from your car, follow these steps:

1. Download the 1b.zip file from [this link\[^1^\]](https://www.car-auto-repair.com/how-to-easily-generate-fsc-codes-for-bmw-cic-units-by-yourself/) and unzip it to the root of your USB flash drive.
2. Power on your car (ignition on is fine, you don't need to start your car) and wait until the navigation system has started completely.
3. Put the USB flash drive in the USB port in the glove box (do not use the USB port in the center console).
4. Wait for around 30 seconds.
5. Remove the USB flash drive from the port in the glove box and put it in your computer.
6. Check if the file 1b.hex is present on the USB flash drive. The file should be exactly 319 bytes in size and you can check your file by opening it with a hex editor such as HxD.

### How to Generate an FSC Code Using BMW CIC FSC Generator
 
Once you have the 1B file, you can use the BMW CIC FSC Generator software to generate an FSC code for your desired map version. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Download the bmw\_cic\_fsc\_generator.zip file from [this link\[^1^\]](https://www.car-auto-repair.com/how-to-easily-generate-fsc-codes-for-bmw-cic-units-by-yourself/) and unzip it to a folder on your computer.
2. Open the BMW\_CIC\_FSC\_Generator.exe file and select the 1B file you extracted from your car as described above.
3. Select your desired map type (Premium, Motion, Move), region (Europe, North America, etc.), and version (2020-2, 2021-1, etc.) from the drop-down menus.
4. Click on Generate and wait for a few seconds. The software will automatically download the Lookup.xml file that contains the key generation parameters.
5. A pop-up window will show you the generated FSC code. Copy and save this code somewhere safe.

### How to Download and Install Map Data Files on Your Car
 
The last step is to download and install the map data files on your car's navigation system using the FSC code you generated. To do this, follow these steps:
