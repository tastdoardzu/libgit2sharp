One of these projects was a collaboration with Firaxis Games, the developer of XCOM 2, to create a new mod for the game that would expand and enhance its gameplay. This mod, called Long War 2, was inspired by the original Long War mod that the studio had created for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM: Enemy Within. Long War 2 was released to the public on January 19, 2017.[17] [21]
  
Long War 2 is a comprehensive overhaul of XCOM 2 that adds new classes, enemies, missions, weapons, items, and gameplay mechanics. The mod also increases the length and difficulty of the campaign, making it a more challenging and immersive experience. Long War 2 is designed for players who enjoy a high level of strategic and tactical depth, and who are looking for a new challenge in XCOM 2.

The mod was well received by fans and critics alike, who praised its variety, complexity, and replay value. Long War 2 was also recognized by Firaxis Games as an official mod partner, and was featured in several promotional events and streams. The mod has been downloaded over a million times from the Steam Workshop, and has spawned several spin-off mods and submods that add further content and customization options.

Pavonis Interactive continued to support and update Long War 2 until August 2018, when they announced that they had ceased development of the mod due to other commitments and projects. The studio also stated that they had no plans to port the mod to the War of the Chosen expansion of XCOM 2, which introduced significant changes to the game's code and mechanics. However, they encouraged other modders to use their work as a base for their own creations, and expressed their gratitude to the XCOM community for their support and feedback.
