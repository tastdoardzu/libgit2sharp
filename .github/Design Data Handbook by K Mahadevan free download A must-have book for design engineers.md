If you are a mechanical engineer or a student of mechanical engineering, you might be familiar with the challenge of finding reliable and comprehensive design data for various machine elements and components. You might have to refer to several textbooks, formulae, graphs, tables and other sources of information to solve a problem in machine design. Wouldn't it be convenient if you could have all such information in one handy book?
 
That's exactly what Design Data Handbook by K. Mahadevan offers. This book is a compilation of design data for mechanical engineers in SI and metric units. It covers topics such as materials, machine elements, fasteners, gears, springs, bearings, shafts, brakes, clutches, belts, chains, pipes, joints, welding, hydraulics, pneumatics and more. It also provides useful information on standards, codes, symbols and units.
