FST-7 stands for Fascia Stretch Training 7, which refers to the number of sets performed for the final exercise of a target body part. The goal of FST-7 is to stretch the fascia, the connective tissue that surrounds the muscle fibers, and create more room for muscle growth.
 
FST-7 Refined is the sequel to the original FST-7 video series (FST-7: Defined), where Hany Rambod reveals never-before-seen techniques and exercises that he uses with his elite clients, such as 7-time Mr. Olympia Phil Heath, 4-time Mr. Olympia Jay Cutler, IFBB pro Steve Kuclo, and IFBB pro Seth Feroce.
 
Some of the new features of FST-7 Refined include:
 
- Pre-loading: performing a high-rep set before a heavy set to increase blood flow and pump.
- Re-loading: performing a high-rep set after a heavy set to flush out lactic acid and enhance recovery.
- Blood-starving sets: restricting blood flow to a muscle group by using bands or cuffs and performing high-rep sets to create metabolic stress and trigger growth factors.

FST-7 Refined covers every major muscle group and shows you how to train them with maximum intensity and efficiency. You will learn how to perform exercises such as:

If you want to see FST-7 Refined in action, you can watch Hany Rambod and his athletes demonstrate the workouts on YouTube[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. You will be amazed by the intensity, pump, and results that they achieve with this program.
 
FST-7 Refined is not for the faint of heart. It requires dedication, discipline, and hard work. But if you are willing to follow Hany Rambod's guidance and push yourself beyond your limits, you will be rewarded with a physique that is refined, defined, and muscular.
  
Of course, training is only one part of the equation. Nutrition is equally important for FST-7 Refined, as you need to provide your muscles with enough fuel and nutrients to recover and grow from the intense workouts.
 
Hany Rambod recommends that people who follow the FST-7 program take in between 1.2-1.6 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight per day[^3^]. That means that if you weight 200 pounds and want to put on a maximum amount of muscle, then you will have to take in as much as 320 grams of protein each and every day.
 
Protein sources should be lean and high-quality, such as chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, whey, and casein. Protein shakes are a convenient way to increase your protein intake, especially before and after workouts. Rambod also suggests using BCAAs and glutamine to enhance muscle recovery and prevent catabolism.
 
Carbohydrates are also essential for FST-7 Refined, as they provide energy for the workouts and replenish glycogen stores in the muscles. Rambod advises consuming between 1.5-2 grams of carbs per pound of bodyweight per day[^1^], depending on your goals and metabolism. Carbs should come from complex sources, such as oats, rice, potatoes, fruits, and vegetables. Simple carbs, such as dextrose or maltodextrin, can be used around workouts to spike insulin levels and drive nutrients into the muscles.
 
Fats are the third macronutrient that you need to consider for FST-7 Refined. Fats play a vital role in hormone production, cell membrane function, and overall health. Rambod recommends consuming between 0.3-0.5 grams of fat per pound of bodyweight per day[^1^], mostly from unsaturated sources, such as nuts, seeds, avocados, olive oil, and fish oil. Fats should be avoided around workouts, as they can slow down digestion and absorption of other nutrients.
