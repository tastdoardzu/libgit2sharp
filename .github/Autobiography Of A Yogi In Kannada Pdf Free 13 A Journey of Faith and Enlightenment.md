Autobiography of a Yogi is divided into 49 chapters, each one describing a different aspect of Yogananda's life or a significant event that shaped his spiritual journey. The book begins with his early memories of his family and his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar. He then recounts his encounters with various masters and teachers, such as Lahiri Mahasaya, Babaji, Ananda Moyi Ma, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, and many others. He also describes his experiences of astral travel, telepathy, levitation, materialization, and other paranormal phenomena.
 
The book also covers Yogananda's mission to spread the teachings of Kriya Yoga in the West. He founded the Self-Realization Fellowship in 1920 and traveled extensively in America and Europe, giving lectures and initiating thousands of students into the path of yoga. He also established many centers and retreats for spiritual seekers.

Autobiography of a Yogi is not only a memoir of a remarkable life, but also a guidebook for anyone who wants to discover the true meaning and purpose of existence. It is a testament to the power of faith, love, and devotion. It is a book that can change lives and awaken souls.

To illustrate his points, Yogananda often quotes from the scriptures of various religions, such as the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, the Quran, and the Upanishads. He also shares many anecdotes and stories from his own life and the lives of his fellow yogis. Some of these quotes are:

> "Live quietly in the moment and see the beauty of all before you. The future will take care of itself..."[^1^]

> "You may control a mad elephant; You may shut the mouth of the bear and the tiger; Ride the lion and play with the cobra; By alchemy you may learn your livelihood; You may wander through the universe incognito; Make vassals of the gods; be ever youthful; You may walk in water and live in fire; But control of the mind is better and more difficult."[^1^] [^2^]
