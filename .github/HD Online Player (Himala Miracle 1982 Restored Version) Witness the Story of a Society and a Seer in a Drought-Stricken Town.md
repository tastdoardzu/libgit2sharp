Himala Miracle (1982) is not only a film, but also a cultural phenomenon. The film explores the themes of faith, religion, superstition, morality, and social justice in a rural Filipino setting. The film's title means "miracle" in Filipino, and refers to the alleged visions and miracles of Elsa, the main character. Elsa claims to have seen the Virgin Mary on a hill, and soon attracts a large following of devotees who seek her healing powers. However, Elsa's fame also brings her troubles, such as exploitation, corruption, violence, and doubt. The film's climax is a dramatic scene where Elsa confesses to the crowd that she has lied about her visions and miracles, and that there are no miracles. The film's ending is ambiguous, as Elsa is shot by an unknown assailant, and some of her followers claim that she has resurrected.
